# Real-Time Chat App

This is a simple **Real-Time Chat App** built with **Socket.IO** and **Express**. It allows users to communicate in real-time using WebSockets, with features like message bubbles, typing indicators, online user count, and timestamps. The app is perfect for those looking to build a basic chat application or learn about WebSocket-based communication in Node.js.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- **Message Bubbles**: Each message appears inside a bubble with the sender's name and timestamp.
- **Typing Indicator**: Shows when a user is typing a message.
- **Online Users Count**: Displays the number of users currently online.
- **Usernames**: Users can choose a unique username to identify themselves.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and modern design for a better user experience.

## Installation and Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-app.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```
cd chat-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```
npm install express socket.io
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the server using the following command:

```
node server.js
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 5. Expose the App Using Ngrok (Optional)

If you want to share the app with others over the internet, you can use **ngrok** to expose your local server. Install **ngrok** if you haven't already from [here](https://ngrok.com/).

Run ngrok with the following command:

```
ngrok http 5000
```

This will give you a public URL (e.g., `https://xxxx.ngrok.io`) that you can share with others.

### 6. Open the App in a Browser

Once the server is running, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` or the ngrok URL if you're using ngrok. You can open the app in multiple browsers or devices to test the real-time chat functionality.

## Project Structure

```
/chat-app
    /public
        |-- index.html     # Frontend HTML layout
        |-- styles.css     # Styles for the chat interface
        |-- script.js      # JavaScript for handling chat functionality
    |-- server.js          # Backend with Socket.IO and Express
```

### Explanation of Project Files

- **`index.html`**: The layout and structure of the chat app, including inputs for messages and usernames.
- **`styles.css`**: Contains the CSS for styling the chat application, making it visually appealing.
- **`script.js`**: Handles client-side logic for sending/receiving messages, typing indicators, and UI updates.
- **`server.js`**: The backend server that uses **Express** and **Socket.IO** to handle WebSocket connections and manage real-time communication.

## How It Works

1. **Socket.IO Connection**: When a user connects to the app, a WebSocket connection is established with the server using **Socket.IO**.
2. **Message Broadcasting**: When a user sends a message, it is broadcasted to all connected clients in real time.
3. **Typing Indicator**: When a user starts typing, a typing indicator is shown to others using the WebSocket connection.
4. **Online Users Count**: The server keeps track of the number of online users and updates the count in real-time.

## Features to Add in Future

Here are some possible features you could add to the app in the future:

- **User Authentication**: Implement login/logout functionality using **email/password** or **social logins**.
- **Message Persistence**: Add a database (like **MongoDB** or **Firebase**) to save messages permanently.
- **Private Messaging**: Allow users to send private messages to one another.
- **Emoji and Message Formatting**: Add the ability to send formatted messages (bold, italic) or include emojis.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for handling WebSocket communication.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the backend server.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time WebSocket communication.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side functionality and real-time updates.

## Acknowledgements

- **Socket.IO**: Used for real-time WebSocket communication between the server and clients.
- **Express**: Used to build the web server that serves the chat app.

### Key Changes:

1. **Fixed Code Block Formatting**: Used triple backticks (```) for code blocks.
2. **Headings**: Ensured headings have proper spacing for clear structure.
3. **Inline Code**: Used inline backticks (`) for shorter pieces of code (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

### To Fix GitHub Preview:

- Ensure there are no syntax errors when previewing the markdown.
- Copy and paste this markdown directly into your `README.md` file on GitHub.

### How to Test:

- After pasting the markdown in the `README.md` file, **commit** the file to GitHub and then **view it** in your browser to see the final rendered result.
- The preview in GitHub should now be correctly formatted.
